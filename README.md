## What is it about?

This starter is based on:
  - [Laravel] 4.2 :  Use the power a lightweight trendy Framework

Use MongoDB for storage, and still Eloquent for ORM:
  - Eloquent for MongoDB : ([Laravel MongoDB]) You can easily use MongoDB (NoSQL) as well as the basic SQL database managed by Laravel (MySQL, PGSQL, SQLite, SQL server). Everything is already configured!
  - Seeder files (js) to set up MongoDB users

Send custom response messages:
   - ApiResponse (extends Illuminate\Support\Facades\Response) to quickly send json encoded response message, with adapted Http status codes, and even failed validation rules

Multi-device session:
   - Token : allow a user to login from multiple devices and track all his active sessions.

Social media login:
   - single config file: *app/config/social.php*
   - [Facebook] Authentication (sdk v4): Wrapper class to easily connect and retrieve info

Reset Password:
  - a simple and safe flow to reset a password with single-use short-lived token. No captcha, no personal question.
